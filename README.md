red//green
===

In this game there are two states, red and green.  
You can only kill enemies when in the corresponding state.  
**Change** between states using mechanics such as pressure pads found throughout the levels.  
Kill all enemies and get to the end of the level to advance to the next level.

Note: Due to the way I made the game and the engine still being in beta, you can only play level 1 without a PlayCanvas account.
If you do have a PlayCanvas account, there is the intro menu, level 1 and a partially built level 2 that are playable.
